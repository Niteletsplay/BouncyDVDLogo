# Bouncy DVD Logo
This project creates a simple bouncing DVD logo animation using HTML and CSS.<br>
You might have seen the classic DVD logo bounce around the screen in the DVD player's screensaver.<br>
Now you can create your own version right in your web browser!

# Customization
You can customize the animation by modifying the following things:
* Replace 'logo.png' with your own image to change the dvd logo.
* In 'css/style.css' change the '#logo'-width to your liking.
* In 'index.html' change the scrollamount of the marquee-elements to speed up / slow down the animation.
